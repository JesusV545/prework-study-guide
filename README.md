# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I was deeply motivated to complete the prework for two particular reasons. The first reason was to be well prepared for the studious road ahead of me; the second reason was to take a leap towards a career change. This project will allow me to have a minimal understanding of topics that will be covered during the bootcamp. Throughout the prework, I studied the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Furthermore, I learned how these four subjects correlate with one another and how I will use them throughout the bootcamp.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML is the foundation/structure of a website.</li>
          <li>It is the first step to making a website. </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>In order for CSS style to be incorporated into the HTML file, it needs to be linked first.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>.card: This will create a profile and give specific characteristics to how a section will look like.</li>
          <il>style.css: must be in the same folder/assets as your HTML code</il>
          <li>Inline CSS: Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet: The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>External style sheet: This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>

          <li>git pull origin main: "pull" command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. "origin" keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. "main" indicates the branch. </li>
          <li>git push: pushes changes we have made locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>
          <li>git add -A: command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The "-A" flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "commit name":creates commit and captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>

            <li>A function is a reusable block of code that performs a certian task when called.</li>
            <li>A for loop will perform a task until certain criteria is met. Could even run infinitely.</li>
            <li>An if statement will run a code through certains prerequisites until it meets certain criteria.</li>
